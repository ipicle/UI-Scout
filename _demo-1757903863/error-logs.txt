Here’s a compact runbook another agent can follow to gain read access to Raycast’s encrypted DB, starting from your current state.

Objective
Open and query Raycast’s encrypted SQLite database using the correct SQLCipher parameters. Win state: cipher_integrity_check returns “ok” and .schema/.tables return data.

Inputs
DB path: ~/Library/Application Support/com.raycast.macos/raycast-enc.sqlite
Key (hex, 32 bytes): cbd5df4666ddcbf1d68ba2184d14c0ccd9a05d11fd3388db60f225a4baf981d8
OS: macOS; Terminal: iTerm recommended
Tools: sqlcipher at /opt/homebrew/bin/sqlcipher (installed), lsof, otool, strings
Current status snapshot
Raycast process was holding the DB open; we showed it and can stop it.
Raycast binary contains SQLCipher symbols (sqlcipher_*), so codec is SQLCipher.
We must try the right SQLCipher parameters; the key may be raw hex or used to derive another key (envelope).
Step-by-step
Ensure iTerm and tools
Open iTerm, confirm sqlcipher exists:
Quit Raycast and verify DB is free
If lsof prints nothing, the DB isn’t locked. If it shows Raycast, kill it:
Back up the DB and work on the copy
Try SQLCipher (raw key) with a minimal param matrix
Test the most likely combos first. Use a quoted heredoc so quoting is safe in iTerm.
Attempt A (v4, 4096, SHA-256):

If not “ok”, try page size 8192:

If still not “ok”, try SHA-512 variants:

If raw hex fails entirely, try passphrase mode (less likely)
If needed, repeat with page_size 8192 and/or SHA-512 as above.
If all SQLCipher attempts fail
Likely envelope encryption: the Keychain key wraps a per-file data key.
Search for hints (salts/iterations/wrapped key) in Raycast’s support/preferences:
If you find a small metadata file near the DB (json/plist) with a wrapped key or parameters, share it and derive the actual DB key.
Runtime capture (only if needed)
Goal: observe the exact key/PRAGMA Raycast uses.
Check entitlements; if Hardened Runtime blocks attaching, note it:
If attachable, use Frida to hook sqlite3_key or PRAGMA key calls; then launch Raycast and log the key material. If blocked, the fallback is to instrument a small wrapper that loads the same sqlite/sqlcipher codec and opens the DB using Raycast’s code path (larger task; not recommended unless necessary).
Success actions (after integrity_check == “ok”)
Explore and/or export as plaintext SQLite:
What to report after each attempt

The exact attempt you ran (params) and the cipher_integrity_check output.
If successful, 3–5 table names from .tables.
Any files/lines found by the grep/plutil searches in step 6.
Notes

Always work on the backup copy to avoid corruption.
Close Raycast during attempts to prevent file locks.
We saw definitive SQLCipher symbols; the codec is SQLCipher. The main unknown is whether the Keychain value is the direct DB key or an envelope key. The procedure above will resolve that.
